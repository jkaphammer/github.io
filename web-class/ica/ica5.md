# In a few sentences, summarize your takeaways from the guest lecture. You should answer questions such as (including, but not exhaustive):

* Have you used p5js before? If so, in what context? Did you like it?
* Was the talk interesting to you? Why or why not?
* What was the hardest part of the talk?
* Are you interested in using p5js in the future, in Web or other contexts? Why or why not?

I haven't used psj5 before, as I took CSCI1300 instead of the ATLAS counterpart. I think the concept of basing the environment off of a sketchbook opens up a new sector of intersections of art and technology. The point of making p5 for inclusivity is very important in a white cis-male dominated professional tech world. It seems like p5 puts access first for everyone, which I think is refreshing to see with many libraries having paywalls/steep learning curves. I think an important quote from Prof. McCarthy is that "no tool is neutral." No matter what you create, the people who will be using your tool hold certain biases and will view its usefulness in different ways. I definitly plan to try out using p5js in the future; as a cs/music technology major I'd be interested to see how I could utilize this library to creat new audiovisual based works.
