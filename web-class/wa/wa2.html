            <p>I'm a 3rd year undergrad studying Computer Science and Music Technology, with a minor in CTD. I love the freedom web development gives you to combine creative and technical skills. One of my goals for this course is to improve my development portfolio. In my free time, I love playing music (the drums specifically), hiking, and snowboarding.</p>
